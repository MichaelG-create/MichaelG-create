### 👨‍🔬 A bit of background

I worked for 12 years as a physics and chemistry teacher in middle and high school. 
This experience allowed me to develop my ability to communicate technical information clearly to diverse audiences.

I led experimental research during my PhD in experimental physics, investigating microscale swimming dynamics of microalgae.
I processed and analyzed hundreds of GBs of experimental videos using:
I processed and analyzed 100+ GB of experimental video data : 
- 🐍 using Python  
- ⚙️ using custom tracking algorithms  
- 📈 extracting trajectory statistics (e.g., mean squared displacement, angular correlations).

I also worked 2 years as a Retail Banking Advisor. That's where I discovered a passion for financial markets.
