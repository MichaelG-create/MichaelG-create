- 👋 Hi, I’m @MichaelG-create
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Engineering
- 🌱 I have learnt Machine Learning (Andrew Ng's course on Coursera), Data Collecting and Storing
- 🌱 I am currently learning SQL, Python, Bash, git and going to learn Streamlit, FASTApi, Spark and Airflow
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever is related to a data engineering project
- 📫 How to reach me : my linkedin profile : https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelgarcia838383/
- I'm currently a physics and chemistry teacher in secondary high school in France.
- I prepare myself to become a data engineer by learning and doing.  
- I got a PhD in experimental physics : I have realized and analysed hundreds of Gb of experimental movies of swimming micro-algaes. My tools : tracking algorithms, statistics calculations on trajectories of algaes (MSD, angular time correlations, dual correlation, etc.)
